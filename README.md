# 10K Hours

## What This App is For
I made this app for myself. It's for my development -- skill development. 
I have always wanted to find a way to gamify my own skill-honing but none of the applications on the market has satisfied me. 

## Where Did the Name Come From
The name came from Malcolm Gladwell's 10000-hour-rule. I am not a believer of this rule after having 
witnessed many cases of people spending more than 10000 hours on skills but never really achieving mastery of them. 
However, I do believe that you can achieve a certain level of proficiency. 
Also, I have seen one of my friends who spend all day every day in his dorm room playing this one particular strategy/simulation 
video game. He told me that he had seen more than a dozen endings after spending 1000 hours 
and that he now is quite invincible in it. This 1000-hour journey only took him one trimester. 
So I kept thinking, "What if I go crazy about one particular thing for thousands of hours for several months? 
Will I have become an expert at this?"

## How do I help myself focus and be resilient?
I believe this can be done by the **gamification**, which can eventually make myself more active.

## How do I gamify skill-learning?
The process has to be personal. This is why making a to-do or tic-tac-toe applications won't work well for me. 
I am not at all interested in making a tic-tac-toe. And also, there needs to be a sense of **progress** with an **ending**. 
Think of GTA or Skyrim. They are open world video game, but they both have main storylines with endings. 
Also, there must be a soft of quicker way to reward the grind. I was thinking back on the days I was playing Diablo 2, 
which to me was a super addictive game. When you look at it carefully, this video game can feel more like 
working at a click farm since you must click tens of thousands of times to get through a stage and 
you have to click rapidly in order to survive combats against monsters and bosses. 
So how did the game developers and designers make players forget about this harsh 'click farm' labor? 
The key must be in the quick reward. You click once to enchant a fatal magic. The magic hits the monster and damages it. 
You click several or a dozen times to kill this monster. You are rewarded by gaining a few points of experience. 
You click many more times to kill a dozen more immediate monsters and gain more experience points. 
Eventually, as you are starting to get tired of clicking hundreds of times, one of the killed monsters drop a fancy item. 
You are rewarded by attaining this fancy item. As you go through this journey, you get rewarded again and again like this.

I believe the skill-grinding can be done this way. Obviously it's not going to be as easy as playing Diablo 2 
or other video games. Playing video games (not all cases... because sometimes there are games with a steep learning curve) 
does not require a lot of mental effort. You can easily get immersed in their world without having to really 
invest your cognitive and intellectual abilities. On the other hand, learning or honing productive skills 
and knowledge can be very harsh. Software engineering, UI/UX designing, wood working, content managing, 
and other skills can be acquired by putting many hours of significant amount of mental energy. 
In order to make such process less painful and more appealing, there must be a sense of immediate reward for 
every little thing you learn and understand. Some lucky people are born and raised this way that they enjoy 
sheer act of understanding new things and won't let go of a dense 800-page book, 
[A Spirit of Trust: A Reading of Hegelâ€™s Phenomenology](https://www.amazon.com/Spirit-Trust-Reading-Hegels-Phenomenology-ebook/dp/B07QF8BZMP/ref=pd_sim_1/145-3524644-7650935?pd_rd_w=GGEvz&pf_rd_p=80152b05-d527-42f7-bbb4-c9d645b6dcf5&pf_rd_r=6YA8HSQB7V0KED3756WY&pd_rd_r=12ee6faa-2a05-4d21-b61a-9a3b0dc8d7a6&pd_rd_wg=yX9mF&pd_rd_i=B07QF8BZMP&psc=1). 
Unfortunately, a lot of us, including myself, are not one of them. We need to be smarter about the way 
in which approach hard topics and boring lectures to get to fruition. For instance, I know how awesome it 
is to be able to build my own Operating System from scratch (which I haven't done yet!) with my own bootloader, 
kernal, and UI. Nonetheless, as soon as I get through the first few chapters of 
[C Programming Language by Kernighan and Ritchie](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628), 
I forget about all the awesome things I can do with C or Assembly. The fruition I mentioned above starts appearing 
like some fantasy land that is far beyond my reach, and the way towards this "promised land" becomes just an infinite loop 
of not-being-able-to-understand and feeling-dumb and feeling-like-quiting. However, if I am able to find something in every 
step and really have fun with it, the journey would feel more like an exciting adventure. 
For instance, maybe the end of each chapter does not have to be so anticlimactic. Sure you cannot build your 
dream application after learning basic syntaxes of C. But if there is a system that provides some alleviation for 
minds accustomed to instant gratification, maybe there is a hope for us.
